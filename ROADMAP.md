#Project Roadmap: Experiment4J Library
##Vision & Mission
**Vision**: To empower software engineers to refactor legacy systems with confidence by providing a robust framework for live, data-driven experimentation. 

**Mission**: To create a simple, powerful, and language-agnostic open-source library that allows developers to safely introduce new implementations by running them as experiments alongside existing code. This will enable them to verify correctness, measure performance, and roll out changes without impacting users.

This project is heavily inspired by the principles behind GitHub's "Scientist" library, and we aim to provide a modern, extensible implementation for a variety of languages.

##Target Audience
   This library is for software engineers and teams who are:

- Maintaining and modernizing legacy codebases.
- Performing large-scale refactoring or architectural changes.
- Needing to verify the correctness and performance of new implementations against the old.

Looking for a safer alternative to "big bang" releases.

##Core Concepts
   The library is built around the idea of a controlled experiment.

- Control: The existing, legacy code path. This is the trusted implementation, and its result is always returned to the caller.
- Candidate: The new, refactored code path. This is the experiment.
- Experiment: The process of running both the control and candidate code paths, comparing their results, measuring their performance, and publishing this data for analysis.

Crucially, if the candidate path produces a different result or throws an error, it is logged, but the user is unaffected because they always receive the result from the control path.

##Key Features
   The library will be developed with the following key features in mind:

 | Feature | Description | Priority |
 | :-------| :------:    | -------: |
 | Experiment API  | A simple, fluent API for defining an experiment, specifying the control and candidate implementations.  | High  |
 | Result Comparison | A mechanism to compare the return values of the control and candidate. This will be customizable to handle complex data types.     | High    |
 | Performance Tracking | Automatically measure and record the execution time of both the control and candidate paths. | High
 | Graceful Error Handling | Any exceptions thrown by the candidate path will be caught, logged, and will not affect the execution of the control path. | High
 | Configurable Rollouts | Control the percentage of requests that will run an experiment. This will allow for gradual, safe rollouts of the new implementation. | High
 | Context Propagation | Provide a mechanism to pass contextual information (e.g., user ID, request data) into the experiment for more detailed analysis. | Medium 
 | Pluggable Publishers | An interface to allow developers to publish experiment data to their preferred monitoring and logging tools (e.g., Prometheus, Datadog, ELK stack, or a simple logger). | Medium
 | Async Support | Support for asynchronous programming models to ensure the library is non-blocking | Low

##Technology Stack & Architecture
   Initial Language: We will start with a Java implementation, as it is a common language for enterprise and legacy systems.

Architecture: The library will be designed with a modular architecture, with a clear separation between the core experimentation engine and the data publishing components. This will facilitate porting the library to other languages in the future.

##Development Roadmap & Milestones
   Phase 1: Core Engine & First Release (Q1 2026)
   [] Implement the core Experiment API.

[ ] Basic result comparison (for primitive types and simple objects).

[ ] Performance measurement for both control and candidate.

[ ] Graceful handling of exceptions in the candidate.

[ ] A default "in-memory" and logging publisher for experiment results.

[ ] Release v0.1.0 with comprehensive documentation for getting started.

Phase 2: Extensibility & Configuration (Q2 2026)
[ ] Develop the pluggable publisher interface.

[ ] Implement publishers for common tools like Prometheus and SLF4J.

[ ] Introduce configuration for enabling/disabling experiments and setting sampling rates.

[ ] Custom result matching logic.

[ ] Release v0.2.0.

Phase 3: Advanced Features & Community Building (Q3 2026)
[ ] Implement context propagation for richer data analysis.

[ ] Develop tooling or integrations for visualizing experiment results.

[ ] Create detailed tutorials and example projects.

[ ] Actively engage with the open-source community for feedback and contributions.

[ ] Release v0.3.0.

Phase 4: Multi-Language Support & Long-Term Vision (Q4 2026 and Beyond)
[ ] Begin porting the library to other popular languages like Python and C#.

[ ] Investigate advanced features like automatic payload cleaning for comparison.

[ ] Establish a long-term governance model for the project.

[ ] Strive for v1.0.0 release in Java.
